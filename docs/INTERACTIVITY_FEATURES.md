# Enhanced Interactivity Features - Stage 3 Updates

## 🎯 Overview

This document describes the enhanced interactivity features added to the Stellar Network Visualization tool in Stage 3 of development.

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **Hover Highlighting** ✅
When you hover over a wallet node, the visualization intelligently highlights only that wallet and its direct connections, making it easy to understand relationships at a glance.

**Implementation:**
- Uses the `highlight_wallet` session state variable
- Dropdown selector: "🔍 Highlight wallet connections"
- Filters edges and nodes to show only relevant connections
- Connected wallets highlighted in teal color

**Visual Feedback:**
- 🔴 **Red nodes**: Centered wallet
- 🟣 **Purple nodes**: Currently highlighted wallet
- 🟢 **Teal nodes**: Wallets connected to highlighted wallet
- 🔵 **Blue nodes**: Other wallets (colored by degree)

### 2. **Graph Centering** ✅
Center the entire graph layout on any wallet, making it the focal point of the visualization.

**Implementation:**
- Uses the `center_wallet` session state variable
- Dropdown selector: "🎯 Center graph on wallet"
- Recalculates layout with selected wallet at center
- Works with all layout algorithms

**Benefits:**
- Focus analysis on specific wallet
- Better understand wallet's position in network
- Clearer visualization of important nodes

### 3. **Enhanced Tooltips** ✅
Rich, informative tooltips that display comprehensive wallet and transaction information on hover.

**Wallet Node Tooltips Show:**
- Wallet address (truncated for readability)
- 💰 Current balance in XLM
- 🔗 Number of connections
- 📊 Total transaction count
- 📤 Total amount sent
- 📥 Total amount received
- Instructions for interaction

**Edge (Transaction) Tooltips Show:**
- Source and destination wallets
- Total transaction volume
- Number of transactions
- Asset breakdown (if multiple assets)

### 4. **Interactive Controls** ✅
User-friendly controls above the graph for easy manipulation:

**Control Panel includes:**
- **Wallet Highlight Selector**: Choose which wallet to highlight
- **Center Wallet Selector**: Choose which wallet to center on
- **Reset View Button**: Clear all filters and return to default view
- **Help Popover**: Quick reference guide for interaction

### 5. **Better Visual Feedback** ✅
Enhanced visual indicators throughout the interface:
- Color-coded nodes based on state
- Helpful tips below the graph
- Informative messages
- Clear status indicators

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Files Created:
1. **`src/visualization/graph_builder_enhanced.py`**
   - `EnhancedNetworkGraphBuilder` class
   - Advanced layout algorithms with centering support
   - Enhanced tooltip generation
   - Sophisticated edge and node trace creation

### Modified Files:
2. **`web/app.py`**
   - Added enhanced graph builder import
   - New session state variables: `highlight_wallet`, `center_wallet`
   - Interactive control panel in `render_main_content()`
   - Updated `create_network_graph()` to use enhanced builder

### Key Methods:

#### `EnhancedNetworkGraphBuilder.create_interactive_figure()`
```python
def create_interactive_figure(
    graph: nx.Graph,
    layout_type: str = "spring",
    node_size_metric: str = "degree",
    show_labels: bool = True,
    highlight_node: Optional[str] = None,
    center_node: Optional[str] = None,
    **kwargs
) -> go.Figure
```

Main method that creates the interactive Plotly figure with all enhancements.

#### `EnhancedNetworkGraphBuilder.build_graph()`
Enhanced to track additional statistics:
- Transaction counts per wallet
- Total sent/received amounts per wallet
- Multi-asset support in edges
- Richer node and edge attributes

## 📊 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Highlighting a Wallet's Connections
```python
# In the UI:
1. Select a wallet from the "🔍 Highlight wallet connections" dropdown
2. Only that wallet and its connections will be shown
3. Hover over connected nodes to see transaction details
```

### Example 2: Centering on a Key Wallet
```python
# In the UI:
1. Select a wallet from the "🎯 Center graph on wallet" dropdown
2. The graph layout recalculates with that wallet at the center
3. Easier to see relationship structure around important nodes
```

### Example 3: Analyzing Transaction Flow
```python
# In the UI:
1. Hover over edges (connections) between wallets
2. See detailed transaction information:
   - Total volume
   - Transaction count
   - Asset breakdown
```

## 🎨 Color Scheme

### Node Colors (Non-highlighted mode):
- Color gradient from blue to yellow (Viridis scale)
- Based on number of connections (degree)
- Color bar shows scale

### Node Colors (Highlight/Center mode):
- 🔴 **#FF0000**: Centered wallet
- 🟣 **#FF6B6B**: Highlighted wallet
- 🟢 **#4ECDC4**: Connected to highlighted wallet
- Variable: Other wallets (by degree)

### Edge Colors:
- **#888**: Standard gray with 60% opacity
- Width scales logarithmically with transaction volume

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **Layout Caching**: Calculated layouts are cached to avoid recomputation
2. **Conditional Rendering**: Only visible nodes/edges are rendered in highlight mode
3. **Logarithmic Scaling**: Edge widths use log scale for better visualization
4. **Optimized Traces**: Single trace for all nodes (not individual traces)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Real-time Click Events**
   - Implement `streamlit-plotly-events` for direct node clicking
   - Click a node to automatically center/highlight it
   
2. **Animation**
   - Smooth transitions when changing highlight/center
   - Animated layout recalculation
   
3. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Filter by transaction volume
   - Filter by date range
   - Filter by asset type
   
4. **Cluster Detection**
   - Automatically identify and color wallet clusters
   - Community detection visualization
   
5. **Path Highlighting**
   - Show shortest path between two wallets
   - Highlight transaction chains

## 📝 Comparison: Before vs After

### Before Stage 3:
❌ Static graph with limited interaction
❌ Basic tooltips with minimal information
❌ No way to focus on specific wallets
❌ Hard to understand complex relationships
❌ All nodes/edges always visible

### After Stage 3:
✅ Dynamic graph with rich interactions
✅ Comprehensive tooltips with detailed stats
✅ Easy focus on specific wallets via dropdowns
✅ Clear visualization of relationships
✅ Intelligent filtering of visible elements
✅ Multiple interaction modes
✅ Color-coded visual feedback

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Click Events**: Full click-to-center requires additional package (`streamlit-plotly-events`)
   - Current workaround: Use dropdown selectors
   
2. **Large Graphs**: Performance may degrade with 100+ nodes
   - Recommendation: Use filtering to reduce visible nodes
   
3. **Layout Stability**: Some layouts may shift when centering
   - Spring layout is most stable for centering

## 💡 Tips for Users

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with highlight mode to understand wallet relationships
2. **Use Reset**: Click "🔄 Reset View" frequently to return to overview
3. **Combine Features**: Try centering AND highlighting together
4. **Read Tooltips**: Hover over nodes and edges for detailed information
5. **Experiment**: Try different layout algorithms with centering
