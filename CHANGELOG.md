# 📝 CHANGELOG - Stellar Network Visualization

## All Stages Complete - Full Release

---

## 🎉 Version 3.0 - Complete Edition (October 26, 2025)

### Summary
All three development stages completed successfully:
- ✅ **Stage 1**: Critical bug fixes (scipy, currency filters, visual feedback)
- ✅ **Stage 2**: Extended filters (direction, amount)
- ✅ **Stage 3**: Enhanced interactivity (hover, click, tooltips)

---

## 📦 Stage 1: Critical Bug Fixes

### 🐛 Fixed Bugs

#### 1. Scipy Missing Error ✅
**Issue**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scipy'` when using hierarchical or Kamada-Kawai layouts

**Solution**:
- Added scipy to requirements.txt (v1.11.4)
- Added scipy to requirements/base.txt (>=1.11.0)
- Created install script: `scripts/install_scipy.py`
- Created test script: `scripts/test_layouts.py`

**Impact**: Hierarchical and Kamada-Kawai layouts now work correctly

---

#### 2. Currency/Asset Filters Not Working ✅
**Issue**: Selecting USDC filter still showed all transactions including XLM

**Root Cause**: Filters were created in UI but never passed to the API

**Solution**:
- Added filter parameters to `fetch_wallet_network()` in `stellar_client.py`
- Implemented filtering logic for assets, transaction types, and dates
- Updated `app.py` to pass filters from UI to API
- Added session state variables for filters

**Impact**: All filters now work correctly and show only matching transactions

---

#### 3. No Filter Feedback ✅
**Issue**: Users couldn't tell if filters were active or working

**Solution**:
- Added filter info to loading spinner
- Added filter summary to success message
- Added blue info box at top of main view showing active filters
- Added tooltips to filter controls

**Impact**: Clear visual feedback about which filters are active

---

### ✨ Stage 1 Features

#### Filter System
- **Asset Filter**: Filter by XLM, USDC, EURC, yUSDC
- **Transaction Type Filter**: Filter by payment, create_account, path_payment
- **Date Range Filter**: Filter by date range (from/to dates)
- **Combined Filters**: All filters work together with AND logic
- **Visual Indicators**: See active filters in multiple places

#### Helper Scripts
- **`install_scipy.py`**: Interactive scipy installation and verification
- **`test_layouts.py`**: Automated testing of all layout algorithms

---

## 🎯 Stage 2: Extended Filters

### ✨ New Features

#### 1. Direction Filter 📤📥
**Purpose**: Filter transactions by direction relative to main wallet

**Options**:
- **Sent**: Outgoing transactions only
- **Received**: Incoming transactions only
- **All**: Both directions (default)

**Use Cases**:
- Analyze spending patterns
- Track incoming payments
- Identify transaction flow imbalance

---

#### 2. Amount Filter 💰
**Purpose**: Filter transactions by amount range

**Options**:
- **Min Amount**: Minimum transaction value
- **Max Amount**: Maximum transaction value
- **Range**: Combine both for precise filtering

**Use Cases**:
- Find large transactions (whales)
- Filter out dust/spam
- Analyze specific value ranges
- Identify transaction size patterns

---

### 🔧 Stage 2 Implementation

#### Backend Changes
- Added `direction_filter` parameter to `fetch_wallet_network()`
- Added `min_amount` and `max_amount` parameters
- Implemented direction filtering logic
- Implemented amount range filtering logic

#### Frontend Changes
- Added direction filter multiselect
- Added amount filter checkbox with min/max inputs
- Updated filter description to include new filters
- Updated active filter display

---

## 🎨 Stage 3: Enhanced Interactivity

### ✨ New Features

#### 1. Wallet Highlighting 🔦
**Purpose**: Focus on specific wallet and its connections

**How it works**:
- Dropdown selector to choose wallet
- Selected wallet highlighted in red/purple
- Connected wallets shown in teal
- Other wallets hidden or faded

**Use Cases**:
- Analyze individual wallet activity
- Understand wallet's network position
- Focus on specific relationships

---

#### 2. Graph Centering 🎯
**Purpose**: Recenter graph on any wallet

**How it works**:
- Dropdown selector to choose center wallet
- Graph layout recalculates with selected wallet at origin
- Works with all layout algorithms
- Centered wallet highlighted in red

**Use Cases**:
- Change perspective to different wallet
- Explore sub-networks
- Better visualization of connections

---

#### 3. Enhanced Tooltips 💬
**Purpose**: Rich information on hover

**Node Tooltips Show**:
```
🏦 Wallet: GDQZZQ...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💰 Balance: 1,234.56 XLM
🔗 Connections: 15
📊 Transactions: 87
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📤 Total Sent: 5,432.10
📥 Total Received: 6,789.00
